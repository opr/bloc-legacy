## Synopsis

A collection of files that make it easy to rapidly prototype front-end components using JavaScript, Sass and [CSStyle's](https://github.com/geddski/csstyle) implementation of the BEM methodology.

## Code Example

HTML to make a component called "my fancy component" with two pieces of text in, one with a fancy option and one without. 

File: **components/my-fancy-component.php**

```html
<div class="my-fancy-component">
    <span class="my-fancy-component__my-fancy-part">Hello</span>
    <span class="my-fancy-component__my-fancy-part --inactive">Hello</span>
</div>
```

The sass below sets up the component: "my-fancy-component", the parts of the component: "my-fancy-part" and an option that can be applied to the parts: "inactive".

File: **assets/styles/scss/components/_my-fancy-component.scss**

```sass
@include component('my-fancy-component') {
  
  @include part('my-fancy-part') {
    color: green;
    
    @include option('inactive') {
      color: #444;
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation

Grab the repo, put it somewhere a web server that can handle PHP files can see it, and navigate to it!

Open **gulpfile.js** and check that the "appUrl" variable on line 4 is set to where you access the project in your browser.

Make sure you have [node and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

On the command line, navigate to the root folder of this project and type:
````
npm install -g gulp && npm install
````

This will install all of the node modules needed.

After that command has run, type 
````
gulp
````

and now visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
